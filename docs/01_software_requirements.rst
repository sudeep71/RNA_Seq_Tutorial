1. Software Requirements
=====================

You will need access to a SHH client before the start of class. It is important you install the client before the lab class and get familiar with it use.


- Mac Users:


You are pretty much set if you are using a Mac or a Linux laptop. Additionally, just install filezila. Please install this program before class (you need the client version).


If you are told your OSX version is too old, we have a a copy of filezilla which you can install before lab.

- Windows Users:


If you have Windows, you will need to install a SSH client, but you dont need filezila  but need to install mobaxterm,

Get the install edition and please try to do this before the class. The install is straight forward and if you need help, please contact before class.


Windows users go down to the using the hpcc section below for further directions.


-FileZlla:


Now for mac folks who installed filezilla. Once installed, open FileZila and click on the left most top icon.

You will see panels. The one on the left is your computer and right is the MSU HPCC.

This keeps a log of files that have been transfered between the two machines



.. note:: Be careful as you can alter/delete contents from both your computer and your home directory on the HPCC

- Using the HPCC:


You would have received a email from HPCC (sometime around January 9th, 2015) saying your account has been setup, if not let your instructor know in advance.

Please get familiar with the HPCC wiki commands found here (https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Documentation+and+User+Manual).

- The HPCC manual has all the material you need if your curious to use the HPCC. If not please try to go through the system access and running your application topics on the wiki.

Go to Document 3 and Document 4

Try to look into basic info, such as how to log into the HPCC and access your directory. 

Try to use commands such as cd, ls, ls -l etc. to navigate and get yourself familiar with the environment.

Don't worry you cannot BREAK the machine.
