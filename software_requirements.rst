Software Requirements
=====================

You will need access to a SHH client before the start of class. It is important you install the client before the lab class and get familiar with it use.

- Mac and Linux Users:


You are pretty much set if you are using a Mac or a Linux laptop 

- Windows Users:


If you have Windows, you will need to install a SSH client.  

I suggest that you install mobaxterm, 

http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html 

Get the install edition and please try to do this before the class. The install is straight forward and if you need help, please contact before class.

- FileZlla

You will have to install this program before class (you need the client version). 

https://filezilla-project.org

Once installed, open FileZila and click on the left most top icon. 

You will get a screen like the one below

- Now fill the following information:

host:hpcc.msu.edu

Protocol:SFTP

Logon Type: Normal

User: Your MSU ID

Password: Your Password


Then click connect

You will see panels. The one on the left is your computer and right is the MSU HPCC.

This keeps a log of files that have been transfered between the two machines



.. note:: Be careful as you can alter/delete contents from both your computer and your home directory on the HPCC

- Using the HPCC:


You would have received a email from HPCC saying your account has been setup, if not let your instructor know in advance.

Please get familiar with the HPCC wiki commands found here (https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Documentation+and+User+Manual)
